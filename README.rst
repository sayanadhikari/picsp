PICSP - (Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Plasma)
===============================================

*PICSP* is an open source scientific program for simulating plasmas using the *Particle-In-Cell* (PIC) method on a structured mesh. The field quantities are solved using *Direct Solver* and *Gauss-Siedel solver*. The focus is to simulate bounded as well as periodic plasma system.
